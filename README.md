This repository consists of c++ codes.

## Inversion count
*Calculates the number of inversion pair present in the array*

## HashTable for unique charachters
*Uses special data structure hash table to determine wether the string consists of unique charachters or not*


## LinkList Palindrome
*Checks wether the given link list is palindrome or not*

## Stack implementation
*Performs basic stack functionalities like push, pop and top*

## Validate Stack Sequences
*Given two sequences pushed and popped with distinct values, return true if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack. This is from https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/*
